# ftf-run-format-v2
Second prototype, the working one, will have bugs and still have to manually adding thing but better than counting by hand I suppose

OK so here's how to use the ftf-run-format-v2 file
You use Python 3
- Set the page count (which is a multiple of 20, remember this, really important, the link is in the file)
- Set the variables using getvarible.py , copy the list into the LIST_SETUP_1 (important also)
- This will produce an excel file, use it to modify
- This include FSSv2, name, link, etc.. of the game
- Only use this for Flee The Facility Speedrun !!!
